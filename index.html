    <p>benefits:
         milk biscuits can be a healthy and convenient snack option, particularly for children, as they can contribute to calcium, vitamin, and mineral intake. However, moderation and mindful selection are key to maximizing their benefits. </p>
    <p>non benefits:
         milk biscuits,  can have negative health effects, especially for babies and children. They are high in sugar and fat, lack essential nutrients, and may contribute to digestive issues and weight gain. The term "milk biscuit syndrome" refers to a variety of symptoms that can arise from consuming dairy and other ingredients found in these biscuits. </p>
    <p>OVERALL VIEW: Milk biscuits can be a part of a healthy diet when chosen thoughtfully and consumed in moderation. They offer a convenient and potentially beneficial snack option, especially for children, due to the inclusion of certain essential nutrients. </p>
